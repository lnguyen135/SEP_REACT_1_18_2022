                  <h2>My Country: Viet Nam</h2>
                  <p>Vietnam offers many contrasting experiences from thriving cosmopolitan cities to serene natural landscapes, ancient landmarks and charming people. </p> 
                  Crossing to the north bank of the Perfume River, you will enter the imposing moated Citadel, built by Emperor Gia Long in 1804.

                   <p>Surrounded by walls 20 m thick the Citadel contains the Forbidden Purple City, home to the Emperor, his concubines and eunuchs! Much of the original structure was destroyed during the Tet Offensive in 1968, although with the help of UNESCO funding it is gradually being restored to its former glory.</p>

                  <h2>Culture</h2>
                  <p>The Vietnamese often feel a heightened sense of belonging and loyalty to their family. This may surpass just the present generation and see them feel an affinity towards ancestors of the past and those relatives yet to come in the future. Individuals are expected to serve their family’s interests before their own and show preferential treatment to fellow family members.</p>
            <h3 class="title">Pictures of my family</h3>
            <p>In Vietnam, the family is patriarchal, patrilineal, and patrilocal, often with two to four generations under one roof. There is the immediate family (nha) and the extended family (ho). In Vietnam, the immediate family is the nuclear family plus the husband's parents and the grown sons' spouses and children.</p>

                    <p>"There is one traditional Vietnamese outfit, the áo dài, which, for the wedding, is worn by the bride and the groom also, if he is feeling extremely Vietnamese," explains Bui of traditional Vietnamese wedding fashion. "The bride wears a red one and the groom wears a blue one, complete with a matching tiered headpiece, called a khăn vấn, this is sort of an open-top turban made of concentric layers of fabric. Family of the couple and wedding guests may also opt to wear an áo dài."</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, what I've seen with less traditional Vietnamese weddings in America is that often the exchange of rings does not happen during the ceremony at all—the Vietnamese portion of the wedding happens at the beginning of the day and then a more modern American ceremony takes place in the afternoon or evening with a processional, officiant, exchange of vows and rings, and recessional</p>
